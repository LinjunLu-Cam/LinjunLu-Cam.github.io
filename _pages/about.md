About Me
======
<hr/>
I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow in the laboratory of Prof. Ioannis Brilakis at the University of Cambridge, where I lead research on large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems enhanced with reinforcement learning to facilitate human-AI-DT (digital twin) interaction for highway infrastructure management. My work also involves spatial-temporal modeling of GIS condition data and graph theory-based uncertainty quantification to support trustworthy highway infrastructure condition prediction and preventive maintenance planning. These projects are conducted in collaboration with leading UK government and industry partners, including Amey, Trimble, Costain, National Highways, and the Department for Transport. 

Prior to my postdoctoral position, I completed my Ph.D. at West Virginia University under the supervision of Prof. Fei Dai. My Ph.D. research focused on developing digital twin-based solutions that integrate AI/ML and computer vision to advance the intelligent digitalization of transportation infrastructure. Specifically, I worked on two major fronts: (1) automating quality control during the road construction phase through real-time monitoring and analysis, and (2) enabling intelligent digitalization of traffic data and road infrastructure for intelligent transportation system management during the operation phase. Some of the developed solutions (U.S. patented) have been successfully deployed for quality control during the construction of roads I-79S, I-68E, and US-50W in West Virginia, as well as for automatic vehicle-infrastructure collision warning on road I-68 in Pennsylvania.
